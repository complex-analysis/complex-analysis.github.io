## INTRO
The study of complex analysis is important for students in engineering and the
physical sciences and is a central subject in mathematics. In addition to being
mathematically elegant, complex analysis provides powerful tools for solving
problems that are either very difficult or virtually impossible to solve in any
other way.

In this book you will find examples, problems and applets that allow you to explore  complex analysis by using the visual interactive power of the computer (or tablet).

UPDATES! This site has been getting lots of visits which is fantastic. I have fixed some typos and modified some applets for better performance. I am also planning to add some new sections covering integration of complex functions. Finally, I will start the Spanish version so more people can enjoy learning and playing with complex analysis.

## WHAT IT IS ABOUT

This book is an interactive introduction to the theory and applications of complex functions 
from a visual point of view. However, it <strong>does not</strong> cover all the topics of a 
standard course. In fact, it is a collection of selected topics and interactive applets 
that can be used as a supplementary learning resource by anyone interested in learning 
this fascinating branch of mathematics.

Some of the topics covered here are basic arithmetic of complex numbers, complex functions, 
Riemann surfaces, limits, derivatives, domain coloring, analytic landscapes and 
some applications of conformal mappings.

What distinguishes this online book from other traditional texts in the first instance is the use of interactive applets that allow you to explore properties of complex numbers geometrically and analyze complex functions by using different techniques to visualize them. For the design of applets I used the following open-source softwares: [GeoGebra](https://geogebra.org/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [Cindy.js](https://cindyjs.org/) and [MathCell](http://mathcell.org/).

Although I advocate for the use of computers as an aid to geometric reasoning,
I highly encourage you to practice your problem solving skills by solving
the suggested exercises (or filling the missing details) that you will 
encounter throughout the sections.

Think of the computer as a physicist would his laboratory. It may be used
to check existing ideas about our world, or as a tool to discover new phenomena
which then poses new ideas or challenges for their explanation. 
Throughout the sections I have provided detailed instructions (in some cases)
to explore concepts and relationships about complex numbers using specific softwares, 
nevertheless you must still keep in mind that computer hardware and software 
are ephemeral things in comparison with mathematical ideas, which are timeless.

## ISSUES?
Of course, no project such as this can be free from errors and incompleteness. 
If you find applets that don't run correctly, or the examples that aren't explained 
quite right, or a typo, please 
[report them at this project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/complex-analysis/complex-analysis.github.io/issues). Thanks for your help!

## DESIGN CREDITS
The initial design of this book was based upon the fantastic book [Collision Detection](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/index.php) written by [Jeffrey Thompson](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/). If you want to learn about the algorithms behind collisions using basic geometrical shapes, you should check it! The current version, released in 2024, was built thanks to the following projects:
