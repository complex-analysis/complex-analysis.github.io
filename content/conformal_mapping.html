        <h1>Conformal Mapping</h1>
        <hr>



        <p>
          Let $w=f(z)$ be a complex mapping defined in a domain $A$.
          Consider two smooth curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ in $A$
          that intersect at $z_0$ and have a fixed orientation.
          Let $z_1(t)$ and $z_2(t)$ be parametrizations of $C_1$ and $C_2$
          such that $z_1(t_0) = z_2(t_0) = z_0$, and such that the
          orientations on $C_1$ and $C_2$ correspond to the
          increasing values of the parameter $t.$ Since $C_1$ and
          $C_2$ are smooth, the
          tangent vectors $z_1' = z_1'(t_0)$ and $z_2' = z_2'(t_0)$
          are both nonzero.
          Then, $\text{arg}\left(z_1'\right)$ and $\text{arg}\left(z_2'\right)$ represent the angles
          between the position vectors of $z_1'$ and $z_2'$,
          respectively, and the positive \( x \)-axis.

          We define the angle $\theta$ between $C_1$ and $C_2$ at $z_0$ is
          as the value of
          \begin{eqnarray}\label{theta-angle}
          \text{arg}\left(z_2'\right)-\text{arg}\left(z_1'\right)
          \end{eqnarray}
          in the interval $[0,\pi],$ provided that we can rotate $z_1'$
          counterclockwise about $z_0$ through the angle $\theta$ onto
          $z_2'.$ In the case that a clockwise rotation is needed,
          then $-\theta$ is the value of (\ref{theta-angle}) in
          the interval $(-\pi, 0).$ In either case, we see that
          (\ref{theta-angle}) gives both the magnitude
          and sense of the angle between $C_1$ and $C_2$ at $z_0.$

        <p>
          Now suppose that under the
          mapping $w = f(z)$ the curves $C_1$ and $C_2$
          in the $z$-plane are mapped
          onto the curves $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ in the $w$-plane,
          respectively. Because $C_1$ and $C_2$
          intersect at $z_0$, we must have that $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$
          intersect at $f(z_0)$. If $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$
          are smooth, then the angle between
          $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ at $f(z_0)$ is
          similarly defined to
          be the angle $\phi\in [0,\pi]$
          between similarly defined tangent vectors
          $w_1'$ and $w_2'.$ We say that the angles
          $\theta$ and $\phi$ are <em>equal in magnitude</em>
          if $\theta=\phi.$

          In the $z$-plane, the vector $z_1',$ whose initial point is $z_0,$
          can be rotated through the angle $\theta$ onto the vector $z_2'.$
          Of course, this rotation in the $z$-plane can be either in the counterclockwise
          or the clockwise direction.

          Similarly, in the $w$-plane, the
          vector $w_1'$ whose initial point is $f(z_0),$ can be rotated in
          either the counterclockwise or clockwise direction through
          an angle of $\phi$ onto the vector $w_2'.$
          If the rotation in the
          $z$-plane is the same direction as the rotation in the $w$-plane,
          we say that the angles
          $\theta$ and $\phi$ are <em>equal in sense</em>.

        <p>
          Now that we have established
          the terminology regarding the magnitude and sense of an
          angle, we are now in a position
          to introduce the concept of
          <em>conformal mapping</em>. We say that the mapping $w=f(z)$ is
          <em>conformal</em> at a point $z_0$ in $A$
          if for every pair of smooth oriented curves
          $C_1$ and $C_2$ in $A$, intersecting at $z_0$, the angle
          between $C_1$ and $C_2$ at $z_0$ is equal to the angle
          between the image curves $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ at $f(z_0)$
          in both magnitude and sense.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will also use the term <em>conformal mapping</em> to
          refer to a complex mapping $w = f(z)$ that is conformal
          at $z_0.$ In addition, if $w = f(z)$ maps a domain
          $A$ onto a domain $B$ and if $w=f(z)$ is conformal at
          every point in $A,$
          then we call $w = f(z)$ a conformal mapping of $A$ onto $B.$

        <h2>Analytics functions</h2>

        <p>
          A remarkable geometrical property enjoyed by all complex
          analytic functions is that,
          at non-critical points, they preserve angles, and
          therefore define conformal mappings.
        </p>

        <div class="theorem">
          If $f$ is analytic in a domain $D$ containing $z_0,$ and if
          $f'(z_0)\neq 0,$ then $w=f(z)$ is a conformal mapping at $z_0.$
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
          Suppose $f$ is analytic in a domain $D$ containing $z_0,$ and that
          $f'(z_0)\neq 0.$ Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two smooth curves in $D$
          parametrized by $z_1(t)$ and $z_2(t),$ respectively, with
          $z_1(t_0)= z_2(t_0)= z_0.$ Also, assume that $w=f(z)$ maps the
          curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ onto the curves $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2.$
          Here $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are
          parametrized by $w_1(t)=f(z_1(t))$ and $w_2(t)=f(z_2(t)),$ respectively.

          <p>
            We wish to prove that the angle $\theta$ between $C_1$ and $C_2$ at $z_0$
            is equal to the angle $\phi$ between $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ at
            $f(z_0)$ in both magnitude and sense.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may assume, by renumbering $C_1$ and $C_2$ if necessary, that
            $z_1'=z_1'(t_0)$ can be rotated counterclockwise about $z_0$ through the
            angle $\theta$ onto $z_2'=z_2'(t_0).$ Then, using (\ref{theta-angle}), we know that
            \[
            \theta = \text{arg}\left(z_2'\right)-\text{arg}\left(z_1'\right)
            \]
            in the interval $[0,\pi].$
          </p>

          <p>
            Using the chain rule we have that
            \begin{eqnarray*}
            w_1' = w_1'(t_0)= f'\left(z_1\left(t_0\right)\right)\cdot z_1'\left(t_0\right)= f'\left(z_0\right)\cdot z_1'
            \end{eqnarray*}
            and
            \begin{eqnarray*}
            w_2' = w_2'(t_0)= f'\left(z_2\left(t_0\right)\right)\cdot z_2'\left(t_0\right)= f'\left(z_0\right)\cdot
            z_2'.
            \end{eqnarray*}
          </p>

          <p>
            Since $C_1$ and $C_2$ are smooth, both $z_1'$ and $z_2'$ are nonzero.
            Moreover, we have that $f'\left(z_0\right)\neq 0,$ and thus,
            both $w_1'$ and $w_2'$ are nonzero. Now, the angle $\phi$
            between $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ at $f(z_0)$ is a value of
          <div class="scroll-wrapper">
            \begin{eqnarray*}
            \text{arg}\left(w_2'\right)-\text{arg}\left(w_1'\right) &= & \text{arg}\left(f'\left(z_0\right)\cdot
            z_2'\right)-\text{arg}\left(f'\left(z_0\right)\cdot z_1'\right).
            \end{eqnarray*}
          </div>
          Applying properties of the argument, we have that
          <div class="scroll-wrapper">
            \begin{eqnarray*}
            \text{arg}\left(f'\left(z_0\right)\cdot z_2'\right)-\text{arg}\left(f'\left(z_0\right)\cdot z_1'\right) &= &
            \text{arg}\left(f'\left(z_0\right) z_2'\right) +
            \text{arg}\left(z_2'\right)-\left[\text{arg}\left(f'\left(z_0\right)\right)+ \text{arg}\left(z_1'\right)
            \right]\\
            &=& \text{arg}\left(z_2'\right) - \text{arg}\left(z_1'\right).
            \end{eqnarray*}
          </div>
          This expression has a unique value in $[0, \pi],$ namely $\theta.$
          Therefore, $\theta=\phi$ in both magnitude and sense,
          and consequently $w=f(z)$ is a conformal mapping at $z_0.$
          </p>


        </div>

        <div class="practice">
          <p>
            <strong>Remark 2:</strong>
            The previous theorem establishes that
            a mapping is conformal at $z_0$ if $f$ is analytic there and $f'(z_0)\neq 0.$
            Such transformation is actually conformal at each point in some
            neighborhood of $z_0.$ This is because it must be analytic in a
            neighborhood of $z_0$; and since its derivative $f'$ is continuous
            in that neighborhood, there is also a neighborhood
            of $z_0$ throughout which $f'(z_0)\neq 0.$

        <p>
          Now, with the help of Theorem 1, it is relatively easy to determine
          where an analytic function is a conformal mapping.

        <div class="practice">

          <p>
            <strong>Example 1: </strong>
            The mapping $w = e^z$ is conformal throughout the entire $z$
            plane since $(e^z)'= e^z \neq 0$ for each $z$. Consider
            any two lines $x = c_1$ and $y = c_2$ in
            the $z$ plane, the first with upward direction and the
            second directed to the right. The images under the
            mapping $w = e^z$ are a positively
            oriented circle centred at the origin and a ray from
            the origin, respectively. As illustrated
            in Figure 7, the angle between the
            lines at their point of intersection
            is a right angle in the negative direction,
            and the same is true of the angle between
            the circle and the ray at the corresponding point in the $w$ plane.

            The entire function $f(z)=z^2$ is not conformal at $z_0=0.$

        <h2>Local inverses</h2>

        <p>
          A transformation $w = f (z)$ that is conformal at a point $z_0$ has a
          local inverse there. That is,
          if $w_0 = f (z_0),$ then there exists a
          unique transformation $z = f^{-1}(w),$ which is defined and analytic
          in a neighborhood $V$ of $w_0,$ such that $f^{-1}(w_0) = z_0.$ Furthermore,
          $f^{-1}(w)$ is differentiable in $V$ and
          \[
          \frac{d}{dw}f^{-1}(w) = \frac{1}{f'(z)}.
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          The existence of such an inverse can be verified
          using the <em>Inverse Function Theorem</em>
          from real analysis in two dimensions:
        </p>

        <div class="theorem">
          If $f:A \subset \R^2 \to \R^2$ is continuously differentiable and
          $J_f(x_0, y_0)$, the Jacobian of $f$ at $(x_0,y_0)$, has a nonzero
          determinant, then there are neighborhoods $U$ of $(x_0,y_0)$ and
          $V$ of $f(x_0,y_0)$ such that $f:U\to V$ is a bijection,
          $f^{-1}:V\to U$ is differentiable, and
          \[
          \frac{d}{dz} f^{-1}(z) = \frac{1}{f'(x,y)}\quad \text{where}\quad z=f(x,y).
          \]
        </div>

        <p>
          If $w = f (z)$ is conformal at
          $z_0 = x_0+iy_0,$ there is some
          neighborhood $U$ of $z_0$ throughout which $f$ is analytic.
          For $z=x+iy,$ if we write
          \begin{eqnarray}\label{trans01}
          f(z) = u(x,y)+ iv(x,y),
          \end{eqnarray}
          we know that there is a neighborhood of the point $(x_0,y_0)$
          throughout which the functions $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y),$ along with
          their partial derivatives of all orders, are continuous
          (a new section about this fact will be available soon).
        </p>

        <p>
          The function defined in (\ref{trans01})
          represents a transformation from the neighborhood
          $U$ into the $uv$ plane. Furthermore, the determinant

        <div class="scroll-wrapper">
          \[
          J_f = \left|\begin{array}{cc}
          u_x & u_y \\
          v_x & v_y
          \end{array} \right|= u_x v_y - v_x u_y,
          \]
        </div>
        <p>
          which is known as the <em>Jacobian of the transformation</em> $f$,
          is nonzero at the point $(x_0,y_0).$ It is easy to prove this
          by considering the Cauchy-Riemann equations
          \[
          u_x = v_y \quad \text{and}\quad u_y = -v_x.
          \]
          Then we can write $J_f$ as
          \[
          J_f = \left(u_x\right)^2+\left(v_x\right)^2=\left|f'(z)\right|^2.
          \]
          Since $w=f(z)$ is conformal at $z_0,$
          then $f'\left(z_0\right)\neq 0,$ and consequently,
          the Jacobian is nonzero at the point $(x_0,y_0).$
        </p>

        <p>
          The above continuity conditions on the functions $u(x,y) $
          and $v(x,y)$ and their derivatives, together with this condition on
          the Jacobian nonzero at the point $(x_0,y_0)$,
          are sufficient to ensure the existence
          of a local inverse of transformation (\ref{trans01}) at $(x_0,y_0),$
          which is established by <strong>Theorem 2</strong>.
        </p>


        <p>
          In other words, if $u_0 = u(x_0,y_0)$ and $v_0=v(x_0,y_0),$ then there
          is a unique continuous transformation
          \begin{eqnarray}\label{trans02}
          f^{-1}(w) = x(u,v)+ i y(u,v)
          \end{eqnarray}
          defined on a neighborhood $V$ of the point $(u_0,v_0)$ and mapping
          that point onto $(x_0,y_0),$ such that equation (\ref{trans01}) holds
          when equation (\ref{trans02}) holds.
        </p>

        <p>In addition to being continuous, the real and imaginary components of
          the function (\ref{trans02}) have
          continuous first-order partial derivatives satisfying the equations
        </p>
        <div class="scroll-wrapper">
          \begin{eqnarray}\label{eqls}
          x_u = \frac{1}{J_f}v_y,\;\;x_v = -\frac{1}{J_f}u_y,\;\;y_u = -\frac{1}{J_f}v_x,\;\;y_v = \frac{1}{J_f}u_x
          \end{eqnarray}
        </div>
        <p>
          throughout $V.$
          Since the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold for $u$ and $v,$ they also
          fold for $x$ and $y,$ that is
          \[
          x_u = y_v \quad \text{and}\quad x_v = - y_u.
          \]
          throughout $V.$
          Consequently, the function defined in (\ref{trans02})
          is differentiable. Furthermore, using the expressions in (\ref{eqls})
          and the Cauchy-Riemann equations we have
          that

        <div class="scroll-wrapper">
          \begin{eqnarray*}

          such that $f:U\to V$ is a bijection (one-to-one and onto)
          and its inverse function $f^{-1}$ is analytic with derivative
          given by
          \[
          \frac{d}{dw}f^{-1}(w) = \frac{1}{f'(z)}\quad \textit{where}\quad w = f(z).
          \]
        </div>


        <p>

          The <em>Inverse Function Theorem</em> states only the existence of a <em>local</em>
          inverse for $f.$ For example, consider the function $f(z)=z^2$ defined
          on $A = \C\setminus \{0\}.$ Then $f'(z)= 2z \neq 0 $ for every point of $A.$
          The <em>Inverse Function Theorem</em> says that $f$ has a unique local analytic inverse,
          which is, in fact, some branch of the square root function $f^{-1}=\sqrt{z}.$
          However, $f$ is not one-to-one on all $A,$ since $f(1)= f(-1).$ Thus
          $f$ will be one-to-one only within sufficiently small neighborhoods surrounding
          each point.

        <h2>The Riemann Mapping Theorem</h2>

        <p>
          In many applications it is common to look for a conformal
          mapping of a domain $A$ onto a simpler domain $B.$
          A natural question to ask is whether such a mapping exists.
          That is, given domain $A$ and $B$, does there exist a conformal
          mapping of $A$ onto $B$?
        </p>

        <p>
          An answer to this question was given by Bernhard Riemann in 1851.
          Although there was a gap in
          Riemann's original proof (which was subsequently filled), this amazing
          theorem still bears his name:
        </p>

        <div class="theorem">
          <strong><span style="font-style: normal !important;">(The Riemann Mapping Theorem)</span></strong>
          Let $A$ be a simply connected domain such that
          $A$ is not all of $\C.$ Then there exists a bijective conformal map
          $f:A\to D$ where $D = \left\{z : |z|\lt 1\right\}.$
        </div>

        <p>
          From this result we see that if $A$ and $B$ are any two simply connected domains,
          with $A\neq \C,$ $B\neq \C,$ then there exists a bijective conformal map $h:A\to B.$
          If $f:A\to D$ and $g:B\to D$ are conformal, we can set $h = g^{-1}\circ f$
          (see Figure 10). Two domains $A$ and $B$ are called <em>conformally equivalent</em>
          if there is a bijective conformal map from $A$ to $B.$ Thus the
          <em>Riemann Mapping Theorem</em> implies that two simple connected domains (unequal to $\C$)
          are conformally equivalent.
        </p>

            To transform $A$ to $B$ we compose $g^{-1}$ with $f.$

        </figure>

        <p>
          Riemann's theorem is of critical theoretical importance, but its proof is
          not constructive. This means that the theorem establishes the existence
          of the mapping $f$ but it does not offer
          a method to find a formula for $f.$ A proof of
          the <em>Riemann Mapping Theorem</em> is beyond the scope of this text.
