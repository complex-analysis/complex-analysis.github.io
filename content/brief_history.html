                <h2>Geometric interpretation of quadratic and cubic equations</h2>


                <p>Consider a quadratic equation
                    \begin{eqnarray}\label{quad001}
                    x^2 = mx + n.
                    \end{eqnarray}
                    From elementary school we have learned how to find its solutions,
                    that is, all the values of $x$ that satisfy equation
                    (\ref{quad001}). To do so we just need to use the widely known
                    <em>quadratic formula</em>
                </p><div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{eqnarray}\label{quad002}
                    x = \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
                    \end{eqnarray}
                </div>
                of the <em>general quadratic equation </em>
                \begin{eqnarray}\label{quad003}
                ax^2+ bx+c = 0 .
                \end{eqnarray}
                By rewriting equation (\ref{quad001}) as $x^2-mx-n = 0,$ we can
                use (\ref{quad002}) to obtain
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{eqnarray}\label{quad004}
                    x = \frac{ m \pm \sqrt{m^2 + 4n } }{2} = \frac{m}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{m^2}{4} + n}
                    \end{eqnarray}
                </div>

                <p></p>


                <p>
                    If we plot equation (\ref{quad001}) we can observe geometrically that
                    it represents the intersection of the parabola $y=x^2$ with the line $y = mx+n.$
                    This can be appreciated in the following applet. Drag the sliders below and
                    observe what happens with the intersection points $x_0$ and $x_1.$
                </p>
                <div>
                    <div style="display:block;" class="ggbElement" id="ggb-element-01"></div>
                </div>


                <p>
                    As you already noticed, we have three cases:
                </p><ol>
                    <li>There are two points of intersection, i. e. two solutions.</li>
                    <li>There is only one intersection point, i. e. one solution.</li>
                    <li>There are no intersection points, i. e. there are no solutions.</li>
                </ol>
                <p></p>

                <p>
                    Surprisingly this has been known since ancient times,
                    even without the use of mathematical symbols or computers.
                    We know from clay tablets dated from around 2000 BCE that the Babylonian
                    civilization possessed the quadratic formula, enabling them (in verbal form) to solve quadratic
                    equations.
                    Because the concept of negative numbers had to wait until the sixteenth century
                    to appear, the Babylonians did not consider negative
                    solutions
                    <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[<a href="#merzbach-boyer" alt="Merzbach-Boyer" title="Merzbach-Boyer">9</a>,
                        pp. 29-30]</span>.
                    We can also find implicitly equations
                    in the geometry developed by the
                    ancient Greeks, as we would expect when circles, parabolas, and the like
                    are being investigated, but we do not demand that every geometric problem have a solution
                    [<a href="#merzbach-boyer" alt="Merzbach-Boyer" title="Merzbach-Boyer">9</a>, Ch. 4].
                    <!--If we ask whether a particular circle and a line intersect, then the answer
              can be "yes" or "no". And when the answer is "yes", the quadratic equation
              for the intersection has a solution; if "no", it has no solution.-->
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now let's go back to the quadratic equation $x^2= mx+ n.$
                    Consider the values $m=0$ and $n=-1.$
                    If we use formula (\ref{quad004}), we obtain that
                    $$x = \pm\sqrt{-1}.$$
                    What is going on here?
                    Most of you have learned from calculus, or elementary school, that we cannot
                    take the square root of a negative number.
                    Then, how do we interpret this value? Geometrically speaking,
                    we can relate the solution $x = \pm\sqrt{-1}$ to the fact that
                    the parabola $y = x^2$ and the line $y=-1$ do
                    not intersect each other, see Figure 1. In other words, there is no solution.
                    In general, if $\dfrac{m^2}{4} + n \lt 0,$
                    then equation $x^2= mx+ n$ has no solutions.
                </p>

                    <img src="../images/chp01/quadraticminus1.svg" alt="x^2=-1" title="x^2=-1" style="width:75%;">
                    <figcaption>$x^2=-1.$</figcaption>
                </figure>


                <p>
                    It is argued that this led to the invention of a new number denoted by $i,$
                    which is equal to $\sqrt{-1},$ and it was given the name "imaginary".
                    If we use $i$ as a number such that $i^2 = -1,$
                    then this value is the solution of the equation $x^2=-1.$
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is also a common practice to point out in courses of mathematics that
                    <em>complex numbers</em>, denoted as $a + b\sqrt{-1},$ are needed to solve certain
                    quadratic equations, such as $x^2+1=0.$
                    However, complex numbers emerged, in fact, from the need to solve cubic equations.
                    Furthermore, when quadratic and cubic equations first appeared,
                    at that time, there was no need to have solutions for all equations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So where did complex numbers really come into importance? To answer this let's
                    consider the cubic equation
                    \begin{eqnarray}\label{cubic001}
                    x^3 = p x + q.
                    \end{eqnarray}
                    Geometrically, this equation represents the intersection of the cubic
                    $y = x^3$ with the line $y = px + q,$
                    as shown in the following applet. Drag sliders below and observe what happens.
                </p>


                <div class="ggbElement" style="display:block;width:798;height:516;" id="ggb-element-02"></div>
                

                <p>
                    As you can observe no matter what line is defined by the parameters $p$ and $q,$
                    it will always intersect the cubic somewhere, even when the line
                    $px+q$ is perpendicular to the $x$-axis and far from the origin (i. e. when
                    $p$ and $q$ are both very large positive/negative numbers).
                    This is because the cubic
                    goes all the way from $-\infty$ to $+\infty.$
                    Thus, there is no line you can draw that won't intersect this cubic.
                    This example is very different from the quadratic case which was a parabola $x^2$
                    and you could define a line $mx + n$ such that it won't intersect the parabola.
                </p>

                <h2>Solution to cubic equations</h2>


                <p>
                    It is well known that the solution of the cubic $x^3 = px + q$
                    was developed in the Renaissance (15th and 16th centuries) by Italian
                    mathematicians. Scipione del Ferro (1465-1526) and Niccolò Tartaglia (1500-1557),
                    followed by Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576), showed that $x^3 = px + q$
                    has a solution given by
                </p><div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{eqnarray}\label{cubic002}
                    x = \sqrt[3]{\frac{q}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4} - \frac{p^3}{27}}} -
                    \sqrt[3]{- \frac{q}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4} - \frac{p^3}{27}}}
                    \end{eqnarray}
                </div>

                This is known as Cardano's formula and here we are using modern notation.

                    To see how this works consider the
                    equation $x^3 = -6 x+ 20.$
                    In this case $p=-6$ and $q=20.$ If we plug these numbers into
                    (\ref{cubic002}), we obtain the solution
                </p><div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    $$x = \displaystyle \sqrt[3]{10 + \sqrt{108}} -
                    \sqrt[3]{- 10 + \sqrt{108}}.$$
                </div>
                Simplifying we obtain $x=2,$ a solution of the given equation since
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    $$8=(2)^3 = -6(2)+ 20 = -12+20=8.$$
                </div>

                Thus, this formula seems to work very well, at least for this case.

                <h2>The genesis of imaginary numbers</h2>

                <p>
                    A few years later after the discovery of Cardano's formula,
                    the Italian engineer-architect Rafael Bombelli (1526-1572)
                    recognized that there was something strange and paradoxical about this formula.
                    He considered the equation
                    \begin{eqnarray}\label{cubic003}
                    x^3= 15 x+ 4
                    \end{eqnarray}
                    and, with perhaps just a little
                    pondering, you can see that $x = 4$ is a solution. This can also
                    be seen in Figure 4. In fact there are three solutions, but
                    Bombelli did not consider negative values, so we won't either.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/chp01/cubic-line.svg" alt="x^3=15x+4" title="x^3=15x+4" style="width:70%;">
                    <figcaption>
                        $x^3=15x+4.$
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <div class="w3-responsive">
                    <p>
                        Then Bombelli used Cardano's formula to solve $x^3= 15 x+ 4.$
                        Thus, considering $p = 15$ and $q=4,$
                        he obtained
                    </p><div class="scroll-wrapper">
                        \begin{eqnarray}\label{cubic004}
                        x = \displaystyle \sqrt[3]{2 + \sqrt{-121}} + \sqrt[3]{2 - \sqrt{-121}}.
                        \end{eqnarray}

                    Here he encountered a very unusual value. If Cardano's formula
                    is correct, this number must be equal to 4.
                    Yet this must be nonsense and the value cannot be real,
                    because inside the cube root we are taking
                    the square root of a negative number, an absolute impossibility
                    at that time (and also nowadays).
                    Cardano also encountered this difficulty but he did not face it up.
                    He did once mention imaginary numbers, but in connection
                    with a quadratic equation and accompanied by the comment that
                    these numbers were "as subtle as they are useless"
                    [<a href="#cardano" alt="Cardano" title="Cardano">2</a>, Ch.
                    37, Rule II].

                </div>

                <p>
                    However, Bombelli overcome this difficulty
                    by seeing that the weird expression (\ref{cubic004})
                    that Cardano's formula gives for $x$ is actually real,
                    but expressed in a very unfamiliar manner. This
                    insight did not come easily. As Bombelli wrote in his book <em>L'Algebra</em>:
                </p><div style="margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 30px;">
                    <p>
                        And although to many this will appear an extravagant thing,
                        because even I held this opinion some time ago, since it appeared
                        to me more sophistic than true, nevertheless I searched hard and
                        found the demonstration, which will be noted below. ... But let
                        the reader apply all his strength of mind, for [otherwise]
                        even he will find himself deceived.

                        Bombelli's great insight was simply to treat $\sqrt{-1}$ as a number and to operate with
                        it following some specific arithmetic rules (the same kind of rules that we use nowadays).
                        Thus he discovered that
                    </p><div class="scroll-wrapper">
                        $$\sqrt[3]{2+ \sqrt{-121}} = 2 + \sqrt{-1} \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt[3]{2- \sqrt{-121}} = 2 -
                        \sqrt{-1} .$$
                    </div>
                    By substituting these values in (\ref{cubic004}) Bombelli obtained
                    <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                        $$x = 2 + \sqrt{-1} + 2 - \sqrt{-1}.$$
                    </div>
                    Then he showed that the squared roots of negative numbers cancel each other
                    [<a href="#bombelli" alt="Bombelli" title="Bombelli">1</a>, p. 169;
                    <a href="#gonzalez-velasco" alt="González-velasco" title="González-Velasco">7</a>, p. 164]. That

                        $$x = 2 + \cancel{\sqrt{-1}} + 2 - \cancel{\sqrt{-1}}.$$
                    </div>
                    And concluded that $x = 4$ is actually the solution of $x^3=15x+4$
                    obtained from Cardano's formula [<a href="#bombelli" alt="Bombelli" title="Bombelli">1</a>, p.

                    see Figure 6.
                    This trick works in only a few cases, however, it helped to
                    understand imaginary numbers and to take their cube roots or
                    manipulate them when they appear aside real numbers.

                <p>
                    Of course, as you can see in Figure 6,
                    Bombelli did not have at his disposal the power of today's algebraic notation
                    (neither computers) and his computations were limited to numbers in "real domain".
                    In fact, most of Italian mathematicians at that time tended to think of cubes or squares
                    as geometric objects rather than algebraic quantities. However, he is credited for
                    proving the reality of the roots of the cubic $x^3=15x+4,$
                    since he demonstrated the extraordinary fact that real numbers could be
                    engendered by imaginary numbers.

                <p>
                    Cardano's formula forced mathematicians
                    to confront square roots of negative numbers.

                    This historical incident is another example that negates the widespread
                    view that mathematics is "made up" by mathematicians. As is often the case, it is
                    the mathematics itself that speaks to us.
                    From this time on, imaginary numbers lost some of their mystical
                    character, although their full acceptance as <em>bona fide</em>
                    numbers came only in the 1800s.

                    Many mathematicians after Cardano and Bombelli made important contributions to
                    imaginary (or complex) numbers. For example René Descartes (1596-1650)
                    coined the term "imaginary" in his book in <em>La Géométrie</em> of 1637 as follows:

                    Leonard Euler (1707-1783) standardized the notation "$i=\sqrt{-1}$"
                    [<a href="#euleri">6</a>, p. 184] and used imaginary numbers to solve
                    quadratic and cubic equations, in spite of the fact that he
                    was still suspicious of these numbers.
                    In his <em>Algebra</em>, for example, he mentioned:

                <div style="margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 30px;">
                    <p>[...] since all numbers which it is possible to conceive
                        are either greater or less than 0, or are 0 itself, it is
                        evident that we cannot rank the square root of a negative
                        number amongst possible numbers, and we must therefore
                        say that it is an impossible quantity. In this manner we are
                        led to the idea of numbers, which from their nature are impossible;
                        and therefore they are usually called imaginary
                        quantities, because they exist merely in the imagination.

                    Later Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) introduced the term "complex number"
                    referring to numbers of the form $a+ b \, i $
                    [<a href="#gonzalez-velasco" alt="González-Velasco" title="González-Velasco">7</a>, p. 191].
                    He also gave four proofs of the <em>fundamental theorem of algebra</em> over the course of
                    his long career. This theorem tells us that
                    any $n$th-degree polynomial has $n$ roots, some or all of which
                    may be imaginary. The first proof that Gauss gave was in his doctoral
                    dissertation of 1799. The last (and perhaps the most elegant)
                    allows the use of complex numbers not only for the variable but
                    for the coefficients as well. Since this necessarily depended on the recognition
                    of complex numbers, Gauss helped to solidify the position of these
                    numbers [<a href="#kline" alt="Kline" title="Kline">8</a>, Vol. 2, p. 595].
                </p>


                <p>
                    The first rigorous definition of complex numbers was given
                    by William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865). In 1833 he proposed to the Irish Academy
                    that a complex number $a+ ib$ can be considered as a <em>couple</em> $(a, b),$
                    with $a,b$ real numbers
                    <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[<a href="#gonzalez-velasco" alt="González-Velasco" title="González-Velasco">7</a>, pp. 192-193].</span>
                    Then he defined addition and multiplication
                    of <em>couples</em> as follows:
                </p><div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    $$(a, b)+(c, d) =(a + c, b + d)$$
                </div>
                and
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    $$(a, b)(c, d) = (ac - bd, bc + ad).$$
                </div>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    This is in fact an algebraic definition of complex numbers.

                    From the didactic and heuristic points of view it is preferable to have
                    complex numbers introduced through a geometrical interpretation.
                    But from the logical point of view the theory of <em>couples</em>
                    is much more satisfying, since it shows the consistency of the
                    theory of complex numbers starting from the consistency of
                    the real numbers [<a href="#carrucio" alt="Carrucio" title="Carrucio">3</a>, pág. 175].

                    Among the many mathematicians and scientists who contributed,
                    there are three who stand out as having influenced decisively the course of
                    development of complex analysis
                    [<a href="#kline" alt="Kline" title="Kline">8</a>, Vol.2, Ch. 27].
                    The first is Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857), who
                    developed the theory of the complex integral calculus.
                    By using imaginary numbers Cauchy was able to
                    evaluate "real integrals" that heretofore could not be evaluated,
                    obtaining stunning results such as
                </p><div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x}\,dx=\frac{\pi}{2}$$
                </div>
                and
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    $$\int_0^{\pi}\log \sin x\,dx =-\pi \log 2.$$
                </div>
                The evaluation of real integrals, in addition to the solution of
                the cubic equation and the fundamental theorem of algebra,
                proved how valuable it was to consider imaginary numbers.

                <p>
                    Finally, the other two important mathematicians are Karl Weierstrass
                    (1815-1897) and Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866), who appeared on the
                    mathematical scene about the middle of the nineteenth century. Weierstrass
                    developed the theory from a starting point of convergent power series, and
                    this approach led towards more formal algebraic developments. Riemann
                    contributed a more geometric point of view on the study of
                    complex functions. His ideas had a tremendous
                    impact not only on complex analysis but upon mathematics as a whole,
                    though his views took hold only gradually.

                <h2>Final comments</h2>

                <p>
                    The foregoing descriptions of complex numbers are not the end of the story.
                    Various developments in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries enabled us
                    to gain a deeper insight into the role of complex numbers not only in mathematics,
                    but also in engineering and physics.
                    The history of complex numbers is fascinating and I highly encourage
                    the reader to consult the primary sources cited here which
                    could serve as a starting point to delve into the historical
                    details that allowed the emergence and development of complex numbers.

                    Do they really exist or are they simply
                     phantoms of our "imagination", and thus truly "imaginary"?
