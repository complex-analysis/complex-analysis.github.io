                <h2>Cauchy's Theorem</h2>

               <p>
                In 1825 the French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy proved 
                one of the most important theorems in complex analysis:
               </p>

               <div class="theorem">
                <span style="font-style: normal!important;"><strong>(Cauchy's Theorem)</strong></span>
                Suppose that $f$ is analytic, with the derivative $f'$
                continuous on and inside a closed simple contour $C.$
                Then
                \[
                \int_C f(z)\, dz = 0.
                \]
               </div>

              <figure>

                <figcaption>
                    Cauchy's Theorem implies $\displaystyle \int_C f(z)\,dz =0.$
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

               <p>
                If the function is not analytic on the whole region inside $C,$
                then the integral may or may not be $0.$ For instance, 
                Let $C$ be the unit circle and $f(z)=1/z.$ Then $f$ is analytic
                at all points except $z=0,$  and indeed the integral is
                <em>not zero</em>. In fact,
                \[
                \int_C \frac{1}{z}\,dz = 2\pi i,
                \]
                as shown in example 2 from the section 
                <a href="complex_integration.html">Complex Integration</a>.
                On the other hand, if $f(z) = 1/z^2,$ then $f$ is still analytic
                at all points except $z=0,$ but now the integral <em>is</em> $0.$
                This value results <em>not</em> from Cauchy's Theorem, since $f$
                is not analytic everywhere inside $C,$ but rather from the fact that 
                $f$ has an antiderivative on $\C\setminus \{0\}.$ That is, $f$ is 
                the derivative of $-1/z.$
               </p>

               <p>
                <em>Proof of Theorem 1.</em> The proof of this theorem is an immediate consequence
                of <strong>Green's theorem</strong> in the plane, which states that, for 
                continuously differentiable functions $P(x,y)$ and $Q(x,y),$

               <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                \begin{eqnarray}\label{green-theo}
                \int_C P\,dx + Q\, dy &amp; =&amp; \iint_R \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) dA
                \end{eqnarray}
               </div>
               <p>
                In Green's theorem, $R$ represents the <em>inside</em> 
                of $C,$ $C$ is traversed in a counterclockwise direction, and 
                $P$ and $Q$ are sufficiently smooth.
               </p>
               <p>Setting $f=u+iv,$ we have</p>

               </div>
               <p>
                By applying Green's theorem to each integral, we get

               <p>Observe that once it has been established that the value 
                of this integral is zero,
                the orientation of $C$ becomes irrelevant.
                The conclusion in Theorem 1 is also true if $C$ is taken in the
                clockwise direction, since then we can use the fact that 
                \[
                \int_C f(z)\,dz = - \int_{-C} f(z)\,dz.
                \]

                <p><strong>Example 1:</strong>
                  Consider the function $f(z)= \exp\left(z^3\right).$ If $C$ is 
                  any simple closed countour, in either direction, then
                  \[
                  \int_C \exp\left(z^3\right)\,dz =0.
                  \]
                  In this case $f$ is the composition of two functions, both analytic everywhere.
                  Thus, $f$ is also analytic and its derivative 
                  $f'(z) = 3z^2\exp\left(z^3\right)$
                  is continuous everywhere.

              <h2>Cauchy-Goursat Theorem</h2>

              <p>
                In 1900 the French mathematician Edouard Goursat 
                proved that the assumption of continuity of $f'$
                is not necessary to reach the conclusion of <em>Cauchy's theorem</em>. 
                The resulting modified version of Cauchy's theorem is known 
                today as the <em>Cauchy-Goursat Theorem</em>. 
                as we can expect,
                with fewer hypotheses, the proof of this version of Cauchy's
                theorem is more complicated than the one just presented.

              <div class="theorem">
                <span style="font-style: normal!important;"><strong>(Cauchy-Goursat Theorem)</strong></span>
                If a function $f$ is analytic at all points interior to and on a simple 
                closed contour $C,$ then
                \[
                \int_C f(z) \, dz = 0.

                    is analytic at all points within and on any simple closed 
                    contour $C.$ It follows from the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem that

                  <strong>Example 3:</strong>
                  We can use Cauchy-Goursat Theorem to evaluate

                  Note that the function $f(z)=1/z^2$ is
                  analytic everywhere except at $z=0.$ In this case, $z=0$ is not inside

              <h2>Simply and multiply connected domains</h2>
              
              <p>
                We say that a domain $D$ is <em>simply connected</em> if every simple 
                closed contour $C$ lying entirely in $D$ can be shrunk to a point
                without leaving $D.$ See Figure 3. In other words, if we draw 
                any simple closed contour $C$ so that it lies entirely within 
                a simply connected domain, then $C$ encloses only points of 
                the domain $D.$ 
              </p>

                  Simply connected domain $D.$

              <p>
                In other words, a simply connected domain has no "holes" in it. 
                The entire complex plane is an example of a simply 
                connected domain; the annulus defined by $1 \lt |z| \lt 2$ is 
                not simply connected.
              </p>

              <p>A domain that is not simply 
                connected is called a <em>multiply connected</em> domain; that is, a 
                multiply connected domain has "holes" in it. For example,
                note in Figure 5
                that if the curve $C$ enclosing the "hole" (on the left side)
                is shrunk to a point, the curve would have to leave $D$ eventually.

              <p>
                The closed contour in the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem does not need to be
                simple when the theorem is adapted to simply connected domains. 
                That is, the contour can actually cross itself. The following 
                theorem allows for this possibility.

                The proof is easy if $C$ is a simple closed contour or if it is 
                a closed contour that intersects itself a finite number of times.
                In the case that $C$ is simple and lies in $D,$ the function $f$ is analytic
                at each point interior to and on $C.$ 
                The Cauchy-Goursat
                Theorem ensures that the conclusion of Theorem 3 holds. 
                On the other hand, if $C$
                is closed but intersects itself a finite number of times,
                it consists of a finite number of simple closed contours. 
                This is illustrated in Figure 6, where the simple closed 
                contours $C_k$ $(k = 1, 2, 3, 4)$ make up $C.$ Since the value 
                of the integral around each $C_k$ is zero, according to the 
                Cauchy-Goursat theorem, it follows that

                The first general form of the integral theorem was communicated to the 
                <em>Académie</em> in 1825 in a memoir entitled 
                <em>Mémoire sur les intégrales définies, prises entre des limites imaginaires</em>

                Goursat presented a proof Cauchy's Theorem in 1884 for the case of a 
                simple closed curve, by dividing by
                dividing up the interior into small squares, 
                showing that the integral around each square of 
                side $\ell$ is bounded by $\epsilon \ell ^2,$ 
                and then adding the results. To obtain this 
                estimate for arbitrary $\epsilon$ he needs 
                the uniform continuity of $f'$ 
                [<a href="#goursat1884">7</a>]. 
                In his 1900 paper, Goursat finally removed 
                the assumption of continuity of $f'$ [<a href="#borger1921">2</a>, <a href="#goursat1900">8</a>]. 
                The argument is as before, but he now subdivides 
                each square until the necessary estimate holds for each
                of them, that is,

                is some fixed point in the subsquare. The important point here 
                is that the same $\epsilon$ will do for each subsquare.

                In 1900, Eliakim H. Moore refined the proof, addressing the 
                treatment of the boundary curve with greater precision [<a href="#moore1900">11</a>].
                He also introduced the modern approach of proof by contradiction, which 
                involves subdividing the domain, selecting the region where the 
                conclusion is most significantly contradicted, and then applying 
                the definition of the derivative at the resulting limit point

                Later in 1901 Alfred Pringsheim presented a criticism of Goursat's treatment 
                of the boundary curve [<a href="#pringsheim1901">12</a>].
                He observed that these issues vanish when the proof technique is 
                applied to a basic geometric shape, such as a triangle. From there, 
                the theorem extends to simple polygonal paths within a simply connected 
                domain by triangulating the interior of the path. Finally, it can be 
                generalized to arbitrary paths by approximating them with polygonal paths.
                [<a href="#hance-olsen2008">9</a>, p. 651]. This is the method that we 
                will use to prove the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem.

                  Using the triangle inequality we have

                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                  \begin{eqnarray}\label{triangle01}
                  \left|\int_{\Delta} f(z)\,dz\right| \leq  \left|\int_{C_1} f(z)\,dz\right| + \left|\int_{C_2} f(z)\,dz\right| + \left|\int_{C_3} f(z)\,dz\right| + \left|\int_{C_4} f(z)\,dz\right|.

                </div>
                <p>
                  Since the four quantities on the right side of the previous inequality 
                  are nonnegative real numbers and, as a consequence, one of 
                  them must be greater than or equal to the other three. 
                  Let's denote the triangular contour of the integral
                   with the largest modulus by the symbol $\Delta_1.$ Thus
                   \begin{eqnarray}\label{triangle02}
                   \left|\int_{\Delta} f(z)\,dz\right| \leq 4 \left|\int_{\Delta_1} f(z)\,dz\right| .
                   \end{eqnarray}
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now we repeat the foregoing process for the triangle $\Delta_1.$ That is,
                  we form triangles within $\Delta_1$ by joining the midpoints of its
                  sides by line segments in the same way as shown in Figure 14 
                  and proceed to the equivalent of (\ref{sumcontours}) and (\ref{triangle01}). 
                  The integral of $f$ along one of these new triangular contous, let's call it 
                  $\Delta_2$ then satisifies 
                  \[
                   \left|\int_{\Delta_1} f(z)\,dz\right| \leq 4 \left|\int_{\Delta_2} f(z)\,dz\right| .
                  \]
                </p>

                <p>
                  We combine this last inequality with (\ref{triangle02}) to obtain
                  \[
                  \left|\int_{\Delta_1} f(z)\,dz\right| \leq 4 \left|\int_{\Delta_1} f(z)\,dz\right| \leq 4^2 \left|\int_{\Delta_2} f(z)\,dz\right| .
                  \]
                </p>

                <p>
                  We continue in this way to obtain a sequence of "nested" triangular 
                  contours $\Delta, \Delta_1, \Delta_2,\ldots,$ that is, 
                  each triangle in the sequence is contained in the one immediately 
                  preceding it. After $n$ steps we get
                  \begin{eqnarray}\label{bound4}
                  \left|\int_{\Delta_1} f(z)\,dz\right| \leq 4^n \left|\int_{\Delta_n} f(z)\,dz\right| .
                  \end{eqnarray}
                </p>

                <p>
                  Since the sequence triangular contours 
                  $\Delta, \Delta_1, \Delta_2,\ldots,$ are nested, there exists 
                  a point $z_0$  in the domain $D$ that is common to every
                  triangle in the sequence. Also, since $f$ is analytic, then $f'(z_0)$
                  exists. If we define 
                  \begin{eqnarray}\label{lambda}
                  \Lambda(z) = \frac{f(z)-f(z_0)}{z-z_0} - f'(z_0),
                  \end{eqnarray}
                  then $\left|\Lambda(z)\right|$ can be made arbitrarily small whenever 
                  $z$ is sufficiently close to $z_0.$ This is true 
                  because $f$ is analytic in $D$ and so the limit 
                  \begin{eqnarray*}
                  \lim_{z\to z_0}\frac{f(z)-f(z_0)}{z-z_0}
                  \end{eqnarray*}
                  exists and is equal to $f'(z_0).$ In other words, for every $\epsilon\gt 0,$
                  there exist $\delta\gt 0$ such that 
                  </p><div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{eqnarray}\label{smallenough}

                  </div>
                  We can solve (\ref{lambda}) for $f(z)$ 
                  and replace this value in the integrand in (\ref{bound4}) to obtain

                <p>
                  Since 
                  \[
                  \int_{\Delta_n}dz =0 \quad \text{and}\quad \int_{\Delta_n}(z-z_0)\,dz=0
                  \]
                  (Why?), the right side of (\ref{expanded}) reduces to 
                  \begin{eqnarray}\label{reduced}
                  \int_{\Delta_n}f(z)\,dz = \int_{\Delta_n}(z-z_0)\Lambda(z)\,dz.

                <p>
                  Now let $L$ and $L_1$ denote the lengths of the triangular contours $\Delta$ and $\Delta_1,$
                  respectively. Then, if we keep in mind how the triangle $\Delta_1$ was constructed, 
                  it is a straightforward problem in similar triangles to show that 
                  $L_1$ is related to $L$ by $L_1=\frac{1}{2}L.$ Likewise, 
                  if $L_2$ is the legth of $\Delta_2,$ then $L_2=\frac{1}{2}L_1 = \frac{1}{2^2}L.$ 
                  In general we have that if $L_n$ is the length of $\Delta_n,$ then 
                  $L_n= \frac{1}{2^n}L.$ 
                </p>

                <p>
                  For any $z\in \Delta_n,$ we have that 
                  $\abs{z-z_0}\lt L_n,$ where $\ds L_n= \frac{1}{2^n}L.$ 
                  If we choose $n$ large enough so that 
                  \[
                  \abs{z-z_0}\lt \frac{1}{2^n}L\lt \delta,
                  \]
                  it then follows from (\ref{reduced}), (\ref{smallenough}) and the 
                  <em>ML</em>-inequality

                <div class="scroll-wrapper">

                <p>
                  Putting (\ref{bound4}) together with (\ref{boundgeneral}) gives us a bound for 
                  the modulus of the integral on $\Delta:$
                  \begin{eqnarray}\label{lastbound}
                  \abs{\int_{\Delta}f(z)\,dz }  \leq 4^n \frac{L^2}{4^n}\epsilon  = L^2\epsilon.
                  \end{eqnarray}
                  Since $\epsilon \gt 0$ can be made arbitrarily small, then $\abs{\int_{\Delta}f(z)\,dz}=0.$
                  Therefore
                  \begin{eqnarray*}

                  <strong>Remark:</strong> 
                  Roughly, "triangulated" means that the closed polygon $C$ can be decomposed 
                  into a finite number of triangles by adding lines as shown in 
                  Figure 16. 
                  Note that we can then proceed as in the proof of <strong>Lemma 7</strong> 
                  and integrate twice along these added line segments but 
                  in opposite directions. If the closed polygon $C$ has $n$ sides,
                  then it can be decomposed 
                  into n triangles $C_1,C_2, \ldots, C_n$ and we would eventually arrive 
                  at the following analogue of (\ref{sumcontours}):
                  \[
                  \int_C f(z)\,dz = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \int_{C_k}f(z)\,dz.

              <p>
                Now the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem can easily be proved using 
                <strong>Lemma 8</strong> and the fact that any closed contour 
                $C$ can be approximated to any desired degree of accuracy 
                by a closed polygonal path.

                <em>Proof of Cauchy-Goursat Theorem.</em>
                Consider a simple closed contour $C$ and $n$ points $z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n$
                on $C$ through wich a polygonal path $P$ has been constructed. 
                Then it can be shown that the difference 
                \[
                \abs{\int_C f(z)\,dz - \int_P f(z)\,dz} 
                \]
                can be made arbitrarily small as $n\to \infty.$
                Thus, by <strong>Lemma 8</strong>, $\ds \int_P f(z)\,dz = 0$
                for any $n.$ Therefore 
                $\ds \int_C f(z)\,dz=0.$ $\hspace{10pt}\blacksquare$

              <p>
                There are several methods to prove the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem. For example, 
                it can be proved for rectangles or disks, see 
                [<a href="#brown2009">3</a>, <a href="#marsden1999">10</a>]. 
                Besides these techniques, there have been many other proofs of 
                this theorem. For instance John D. Dixon made a remarkably short and 
                elegant proof, which requires only the basics of complex 
                function theore in convex sets [<a href="#dixon1971">6</a>]. 
                Rudolf Výborný provided a prove using
                differentiable homotopy [<a href="#vyborny1979">14</a>].
