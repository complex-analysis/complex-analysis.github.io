                <h2>Cauchy's Theorem</h2>

               <p>
                In 1852 the French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy proved 
                one of the most important theorems in complex analysis:
               </p>

               <div class="theorem">
                <span style="font-style: normal!important;"><strong>(Cauchy's Theorem)</strong></span>
                Suppose that $f$ is analytic, with the derivative $f'$
                continuous on and inside a closed simple contour $C.$
                Then
                \[
                \int_C f(z)\, dz = 0.
                \]
               </div>

              <figure>

                <figcaption>
                    Cauchy's Theorem: $\displaystyle \int_C f(z)\,dz =0.$
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

               <p>
                If the function is not analytic on the whole region inside $C,$
                then the integral may or may not be $0.$ For instance, 
                Let $C$ be the unit circle and $f(z)=1/z.$ Then $f$ is analytic
                at all points except $z=0,$  and indeed the integral is
                <em>not zero</em>. In fact,
                \[
                \int_C \frac{1}{z}\,dz = 2\pi i,
                \]
                as shown in example 2 from the section 
                <a href="complex_integration.html">Complex Integration</a>.
                On the other hand, if $f(z) = 1/z^2,$ then $f$ is still analytic
                at all points except $z=0,$ but now the integral <em>is</em> $0.$
                This value results <em>not</em> from Cauchy's Theorem, since $f$
                is not analytic everywhere inside $C,$ but rather from the fact that 
                $f$ has an antiderivative on $\C\setminus \{0\}.$ That is, $f$ is 
                the derivative of $-1/z.$
               </p>

               <p>
                <em>Proof of Theorem 1.</em> The proof of this theorem is an immediate consequence
                of <strong>Green's theorem</strong> in the plane, which states that, for 
                continuously differentiable functions $P(x,y)$ and $Q(x,y),$

                \begin{eqnarray}\label{green-theo}
                \int_C P\,x + Q\, dy &amp; =&amp; \iint_R \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) dA
                \end{eqnarray}
               </div>
               <p>
                In Green's theorem, $R$ represents the <em>inside</em> 
                of $C,$ $C$ is traversed in a counterclockwise direction, and 
                $P$ and $Q$ are sufficiently smooth.
               </p>
               <p>Setting $f=u+iv,$ we have</p>

               </div>
               <p>
                By applying Green's theorem to each integral, we get

               <p>Observe that once it has been established that the value 
                of this integral is zero,
                the orientation of $C$ becomes irrelevant.
                The conclusion in Theorem 1 is also true if $C$ is taken in the
                clockwise direction, since then we can use the fact that 
                \[
                \int_C f(z)\,dz = - \int_{-C} f(z)\,dz.
                \]

                  any simple closed countour, in either direction, then
                  \[
                  \int_C \exp\left(z^3\right)\,dz =0.
                  \]
                  In this case $f$ is the composition of two functions, both analytic everywhere.
                  Thus, $f$ is also analytic and its derivative 
                  $f'(z) = 3z^2\exp\left(z^3\right)$
                  is continuous everywhere.

              <h2>Cauchy-Goursat Theorem</h2>

              <p>
                In 1883 the French mathematician Edouard Goursat 
                proved that the assumption of continuity of $f'$
                is not necessary to reach the conclusion of <em>Cauchy's theorem</em>. 
                The resulting modified version of Cauchy's theorem is known 
                today as the <em>Cauchy-Goursat Theorem</em>. 
                as we can expect,
                with fewer hypotheses, the proof of this version of Cauchy's
                theorem is more complicated than the one just presented.

              <div class="theorem">
                <span style="font-style: normal!important;"><strong>(Cauchy-Goursat Theorem)</strong></span>
                If a function $f$ is analytic at all points interior to and on a simple 
                closed contour $C,$ then
                \[
                \int_C f(z) \, dz = 0.

                    is analytic at all points within and on any simple closed 
                    contour $C.$ It follows from the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem that

                  <strong>Example 3:</strong>
                  We can use Cauchy-Goursat Theorem to evaluate

                  Note that the function $f(z)=1/z^2$ is
                  analytic everywhere except at $z=0.$ In this case, $z=0$ is not inside

              <h2>Simply and multiply connected domains</h2>
              
              <p>
                We say that a domain $D$ is <em>simply connected</em> if every simple 
                closed contour $C$ lying entirely in $D$ can be shrunk to a point
                without leaving $D.$ See Figure 3. In other words, if we draw 
                any simple closed contour $C$ so that it lies entirely within 
                a simply connected domain, then $C$ encloses only points of 
                the domain $D.$ 
              </p>

              <figure>

                  Simply connected domain $D.$
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              

              <p>
                In other words, a simply connected domain has no "holes" in it. 
                The entire complex plane is an example of a simply 
                connected domain; the annulus defined by $1 \lt |z| \lt 2$ is 
                not simply connected.
              </p>

              <figure id="annulus">
                <img src="../images/chp01/annulus.svg" alt="Annulus" title="Annulus" style="width:50%;">

               </figure>
                
              <p>A domain that is not simply 
                connected is called a <em>multiply connected</em> domain; that is, a 
                multiply connected domain has "holes" in it. For example,
                note in Figure 5
                that if the curve $C$ enclosing the "hole" (on the left side)
                is shrunk to a point,
                the curve would have to leave $D$ eventually. 
              </p>

              <p>
                The closed contour in the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem does not need to be
                simple when the theorem is adapted to simply connected domains. 
                That is, the contour can actually cross itself. The following 
                theorem allows for this possibility.
              </p>

              <div class="theorem">
                If a function $f$ is analytic throughout a simply simple connected domain $D,$ 
                then
                \[
                \int_C f(z) \, dz = 0.
                \]
                for every closed contour $C$ lying in $D.$
              </div>

              <p>
                The proof is easy if $C$ is a simple closed contour or if it is 
                a closed contour that intersects itself a finite number of times.
                In the case that $C$ is simple and lies in $D,$ the function $f$ is analytic
                at each point interior to and on $C.$ 
                The Cauchy-Goursat
                Theorem ensures that the conclusion of Theorem 3 holds. 
                On the other hand, if $C$
                is closed but intersects itself a finite number of times,
                it consists of a finite number of simple closed contours. 
                This is illustrated in Figure ??, where the simple closed 
                contours $C_k$ $(k = 1, 2, 3, 4)$ make up $C.$ Since the value 
                of the integral around each $C_k$ is zero, according to the 
                Cauchy-Goursat theorem, it follows that

                A function $f$ that is analytic throughout a simply simple connected domain $D$

                If $f$ is analytic in a multiply connected domain $D$ then we cannot conclude 
                that $\int_C f(z)\,dz=0$  for every simple closed contour $C$ in $D.$
                Suppose that $D$ is muliply connected with two "holes". 
                Let $C,$ $C_1$ and $C_2$ be simple 
                closed contours such that each $C_k$ surrounds only one "hole" in the 
                domain and are inside $C.$ See Figure 7.

              <p>
                Now, suppose also that
                $f$ is analytic on each contour and throughout 
                the multiply connected domain consisting of 
                the points inside $C$ and exterior to each $C_k.$
                Assume that $C$ is described in the counterclockwise direction and 
                each $C_k$ is described in the clockwise direction. 
                We introduce a polygonal path $L_1,$ consisting
                of a finite number of line segments joined end to end, 
                to connect the outer contour $C$ to the inner contour $C_1.$
                We introduce another polygonal path $L_2$ which connects 
                $C_1$ to $C_2;$ and finally another polygonal path
                $L_3$ connecting $C_3$ to $C.$

                As indicated in Figure 9, two simple closed contours 
                $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ can be formed, each consisting of polygonal paths
                $L_k$ or $-L_k$ and pieces of $C$ and $C_k$ and each described in
                 such a direction that the points enclosed by them 
                 lie to the left. Here we can apply the 
                 Cauchy-Goursat Theorem to $f$ on $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2,$ 
                 and the sum of the 
                 values of the integrals over those contours is found 
                 to be zero. Since the integrals in opposite directions 
                 along each path $L_k$ cancel,
                 only the integrals along $C$ 
                 and the $C_k$ remain. Thus we obtain

                The following corollary is known as the <strong>principle of deformation of

                 into $C_2$ always passing through points at
                 which $f$ is analytic, then the value of the integral 
                 of $f$ over $C_1$ never changes.

                  We can use the previous corollary to show that 
                  \[
